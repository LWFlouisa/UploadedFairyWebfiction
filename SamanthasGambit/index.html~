<h2>ISSUE #1 The Broken Flute</h2>

MOTHER: I would rather mow all the grass in the lawn.</p>

<p>Panel 2. SAMANTHA, JKOVO, and their parents pack their bags to move to the Northern Union in order to evade the electro-magnetic bombs being dropped. The bedroom is empty, with visual elements of JKOVO’s childhood memories having imprints that remain.</p>
